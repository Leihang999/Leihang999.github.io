### a sinusoidal wave model
Divide the road into segments using a sinusoidal wave model to create a virtual "lane" for each vehicle


## Predict potential collisions by analyzing the sinusoidal waves of multiple vehicles

Analyze the sinusoidal waves of multiple vehicles to predict potential collisions
Use the phase shift and amplitude of the waves to determine the likelihood of a collision
### Adjust the phase shift of each vehicle's sinusoidal wave to ensure collision-free arrival at the intersection point

Adjust the phase shift of each vehicle's sinusoidal wave to ensure that they arrive at the intersection point at different times
This allows vehicles to pass through the intersection without stopping or colliding with each other
### Consider the impact of collisions between different collision points

Model the collision points as a network to study the interactions between them
Use graph theory and network analysis to optimize the phase shifts of the vehicles and minimize the impact of collisions between different collision points
