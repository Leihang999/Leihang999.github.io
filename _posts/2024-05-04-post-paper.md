### Sinusoidal Energy Model
#### Road Discretization
Divide the road ahead into segments, each equal to one wavelength (λ) of the sinusoidal wave. This will enable the vehicle to move one wavelength at a time, facilitating collision prediction and avoidance.

Let's define the road discretization as follows:

Initial position: $x₀$
End position: $x_end$
Segment length: Δx = k * Δt, where k is an integer
Number of segments: N = (x_end - x₀) / Δx, where x_end is the end position of the road
$$x_i = x_0 + i * \Delta x, \quad i = 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1$$

#### Sinusoidal Wave Modeling

Model each vehicle's movement as a sinusoidal wave, where the wave's half-wavelength (λ/2) is the sum of the vehicle's length (l) and safety distance (d).

Let's define the sinusoidal wave model as follows:

Vehicle length: l
Safety distance: d
Half-wavelength: λ/2 = l + d
Wavelength: λ = 2(l + d)
Amplitude: A (representing the vehicle's energy profile)
Phase: φ (representing the vehicle's position on the road)
The sinusoidal wave model can be expressed as:

y(x, t) = A * sin(2π(x - φ) / λ)

where x is the position on the road, t is time, and y(x, t) is the energy profile of the vehicle at position x and time t.

Vehicle Energy Function

The vehicle's energy function, E(x, t), can be derived from the sinusoidal wave model:

E(x, t) = (1/2) * A^2 * sin^2(2π(x - φ) / λ)

The energy function represents the vehicle's energy profile at position x and time t.

RSU Reception and Collision Prediction

Roadside units (RSUs) receive the sinusoidal energy functions from approaching vehicles and predict potential collision points by integrating the energy functions over time.

Let's define the RSU reception and collision prediction as follows:

RSU reception: E_RSU(x, t) = E(x, t) * G(x) (where G(x) is the gain function representing the RSU's reception characteristics)
Collision prediction: ∫[E_RSU(x, t) * dt] > threshold (where threshold is a predetermined value indicating a potential collision)
By integrating the energy functions over time, the RSU can predict potential collision points and trigger collision avoidance strategies.



## Predict potential collisions by analyzing the sinusoidal waves of multiple vehicles

Analyze the sinusoidal waves of multiple vehicles to predict potential collisions
Use the phase shift and amplitude of the waves to determine the likelihood of a collision
### Adjust the phase shift of each vehicle's sinusoidal wave to ensure collision-free arrival at the intersection point

Adjust the phase shift of each vehicle's sinusoidal wave to ensure that they arrive at the intersection point at different times
This allows vehicles to pass through the intersection without stopping or colliding with each other
### Consider the impact of collisions between different collision points

Model the collision points as a network to study the interactions between them
Use graph theory and network analysis to optimize the phase shifts of the vehicles and minimize the impact of collisions between different collision points
