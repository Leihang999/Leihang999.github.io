### Definition of Position
Let $y(x,t)$ be the position of a vehicle at time $t$ and location $x$ along the direction of motion.
Wave Equation
The wave equation that governs the motion of the vehicle is:
$$\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}$$
where $c$ is the wave speed, which can be interpreted as the average speed of the vehicle.
### Initial Conditions
The initial conditions are specified as:
$$y(x,0) = y_0(x)$$ $$\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}(x,0) = v_0(x)$$
where $y_0(x)$ is the initial position of the vehicle and $v_0(x)$ is the initial velocity of the vehicle.
### Boundary Conditions
The boundary conditions can be specified as:
$$y(0,t) = y_L(t)$$ $$y(L,t) = y_R(t)$$
where $y_L(t)$ and $y_R(t)$ are the positions of the vehicle at the left and right boundaries, respectively.
### Source Term
The source term can be added to the wave equation to account for external influences, such as acceleration or braking:
$$\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} + f(x,t)$$
where $f(x,t)$ is the source term.
### Physical Interpretation
The physical interpretation of the wave equation is that the position of the vehicle $y(x,t)$ can be thought of as a wave that propagates along the direction of motion. The wave speed $c$ determines the speed at which the wave propagates. The initial conditions specify the initial position and velocity of the vehicle, while the boundary conditions specify the constraints on the motion of the vehicle. The source term accounts for external influences on the motion of the vehicle.
